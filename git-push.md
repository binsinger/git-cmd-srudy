### git 推送本地分支到远程
- git push [-u] [remote] [branch-name>]

- git push origin master
> Find a ref that matches master in the source repository (most likely, it would find refs/heads/master), and update the same ref (e.g. refs/heads/master) in origin repository with it. If master did not exist remotely, it would be created.
